# create-vue

An easy way to start a Vue project

## Usage

```sh
npm init vue@3
```

Or, if you need to support IE11, you can create a Vue 2 project with:

```sh
npm init vue@2
```

Note that the version number (`@3` or `@2`) MUST NOT be omitted, otherwise `npm` may resolve to a cached and outdated version of the package.
